# WHY IT MATTERS
<br/>
Tetrameet wants to increase the equity of workplace communication. According to both expert research and collected personal experiences, overwhelming amounts of minority and women employees have felt a communication imbalance while participating in workplace meetings. As these meetings are the heart of any company, and even more crucial as we've transitioned to online work, this inequal participation can hurt these employees' progress in their careers as well as the companies' bottom line.


# BASIC USER GUIDE
<br/>
#### **Step 1:** 

Add your online meeting across all tele-work platforms to our user dashboard and start our custom automated conversation analyzer: _Tetra_


#### **Step 2:** 

Have a successful and productive meeting while Tetra passively monitors communication. 


#### **Step 3:** 

Check our reports page for feedback on user and meeting participation and equity statistics. 


#### **Step 4:** 

Use the feedback to incrementally improve company culture and make a safer and more equitable space.


# How It Works 
<br/>
After Step 2, we start our analysis. 

First, Tetra takes the meeting recording and analyzes it using the _Speaker Diarization API_ from Google's Speech API Set. We also run it through our own model to separately determine whether speaker changes were productive or interruptive. 


Compiling the speaker variance, speaker timings, and interruption information, we produce a meeting report and over time generate a complete picture of the equity of workplace conversations.
